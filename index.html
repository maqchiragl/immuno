    <div>
        ​​In India, an estimated 26 millions of children are born every year. As per Census 2011, the share of children (0-6 years) accounts 13% of the total population in the Country. An estimated 12.7 lakh children die every year before completing 5 years of age. However, 81% of under-five child morality takes place within one year of the birth which accounts nearly 10.5 lakh infant deaths whereas 57% of under-five deaths take place within first one month of life accounts 7.3 lakh neo-natal deaths every year in the Country.&#160;

            <li>​Immunization Programme is one of the key interventions for protection of children from life threatening conditions, which are preventable. It is one of the largest immunization programme in the world and a major public health intervention in the country.</li>
            <li>Immunization Programme in India was introduced in 1978 as Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI)</li>
            <li>The programme gained momentum in 1985 and was expanded as Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) to be implemented in phased manner to cover all districts in the country by 1989-90.</li>
            <li>UIP become a part of Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Programme in 1992 Since, 1997, immunization activities have been an important component of National Reproductive and Child Health Programme and is currently one of the key areas under National Rural Health Mission (NHM) since 2005</li>
            <li>Under the Universal Immunization Programme, Government of India is providing vaccination to prevent seven vaccine preventable diseases i.e.Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis and Hepatitis B&#160;<br /></li>

Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that effects the liver, infection can last from a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness. Two different types of infection exist for this disease, &quot;acute&quot; and &quot;chronic.&quot; Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.</p>

This vaccine is given as a series of shots, the first dose is given at birth, the second between 1 and 2 months, and the third, and possibly fourth, between 6 and 18 months. Some side effects of this vaccination include:</p>

                                <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; line-height: inherit;">The rotavirus is most commonly found in infants and young children, but older children and adults can also become infected. Prior to the introduction of the vaccine in 2006, almost all children in the United States became infected with the virus before their 5th birthday. Each year, prior to 2006, rotavirus was responsible for more than 400,000 doctors visits, more than 200,000 emergency room visits, 55,000 to 70,000 hospitalizations, and 20 to 60 deaths in children under the age of 5. Globally, rotavirus is still the cause of approximately half a million deaths each year in children younger than 5 years of age. Unfortunately, there are many strains of rotavirus and the vaccine can not cover all of them, so it is still possible for a child to become infected with rotavirus. Having the illness previously also does not grant immunity, again because there are so many different strains. However, the first infection usually causes the most severe symptoms.</p>

This vaccine is a 2 or 3 dose series, depending on the brand of the vaccine, that is given at 2 and 4 months in the 2 dose series and at 2,4 and 6 months in the 3 dose series. Studies show that this vaccine is 85-98% effective against severe rotavirus disease and is 74-87% effective against rotavirus disease of any severity in the first year after the vaccination.</p>

In 1921, the U.S. recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria which resulted in 15,520 death. Before the vaccine became widely available in the 1920s, up to half the people that were infected died from this disease. In the past decade, the United States has had less than 5 reported cases of diphtheria. Unfortunately, the disease is still an issue globally with 4,887 cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2011.</p>

The bacteria is spread through respiratory secretions, often through coughing or sneezing, or just from breathing in the bacteria while around someone who is infected. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the Pertussis vaccine is dependent on herd immunity, if pertussis is circulating in the community it is still possible for a vaccinated individual, of any age, to become ill. However, those that are vaccinated may have a less severe infection.</p>

The disease begins with cold-like symptoms and after a week or two, severe coughing begins that can continue for 10 weeks or more. Infants may develop &quot;apnea&quot; rather than a cough. Apnea is when the child stops breathing momentarily. Approximately half of the infants, younger than one year of age, who get the disease are hospitalized.</p>

Today in the United States, tetanus is an uncommon disease with an average of only 29 cases reported per year between 1996 and 2009. Nearly all of these cases are of people who were never vaccinated for tetanus or adults who did not keep up to date with their boosters.</p>

The bacteria is found everywhere in the environment including in dirt, dust and manure. Tetanus is spread when the bacteria gets into the body through an open wound such as cuts, puncture wounds, burns, brush injuries and injuries with dead tissues. Although rare, a person may also become infected with tetanus through superficial wounds (just the top layer of skin has been removed), surgical procedures, insect bites, dental infection, compound fractures (where the broken bone has pierced through the skin), chronic sores and infections and intravenous drug use.</p>

Getting the flu also increases a person&#39;s risk for getting pneumococcal disease.&#160;PCV13 is a series of 4 shots given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The last is given between 12 to 15 months of age.</p>

It caused severe illness in thousands of people in the United States each year until the vaccine was introduced in 1955. Most people infected have no symptoms, but for less than 1% of people who develop paralysis it can lead to permanent disability and even death.</p>

One is an inactivated form of the virus (IPV) which is given as a shot. This is the only form that is used in the United States. The other form is given orally (OPV) and is used all over the world. OPV has a risk of causing vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) which occurred in one child out of every 2.4 million. But it does have advantages over IPV in that it provides intestinal immunity and provides secondary spread of the vaccine to unprotected people that come in contact with the vaccinated person. A person is considered to be fully immunized if they have received a primary series of at least three doses of IPV, OPV, or four doses of any combination of IPV and OPV. These doses are given at 2, and 4 months of age, again between 6 and 18 months of age.</p>

Unfortunately there are a vast array of strains of influenza, so a single vaccine can not prevent all of them. The shot prevents 3 or 4 different influenza viruses and it takes about 2 weeks after the injection for protection to develop. This protection lasts from several months to a year. Multi-dose vials of the flu shot contain thimerosal which was once believed to cause autism in children. Studies have shown that this correlation between thimerosal and autism does not exist. Thimerosal is used in these multi-dose vials to prevent contamination from multiple preparations. Contamination of the vaccine could cause serious infection. In a .5mL dose (which is in a single flu shot), there is 25&#160;µg (micrograms) of mercury. This is 0.01% of the dose.&#160;Single dose vials do not contain thimerosal.</p>

It is caused by the&#160;<em>Varicella-zoster</em>&#160;virus (VZV). Before the vaccine, about 4 million people each year in the United States would get chicken pox. About 10,600 people were hospitalized and 100 to 150 died each year.</p>

It also spreads from person to person contact such as when there is improper hand washing after bathroom use, changing diapers, or sexual contact with an infected partner (not limited to anal-to oral contact). Contaminated food or water is more common in areas with poor sanitary conditions or poor personal hygiene. In the United States, chlorination of the water kills Hepatitis A virus that enters the water supply. Hepatitis A can live outside the body for months. High temperatures (185 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 1 minute) can kill the virus, freezing can not.</p>

In pregnant women in can cause miscarriages or pre-mature births. While measles is almost gone from the United States, it still kills about 164,000 people each year around the world. In developing countries that suffer from malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency, measles has been known to kill as many as 1 out of 4 people and it is the leading cause of blindness among African children.</p>

Very rarely a pregnant woman can pass HPV to her baby during delivery. The child can develop recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) which is a rare condition in which warts grow in the throat. It is also known as juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP)</p>

In 90% of cases, the body&#39;s immune system clears HPV within 2 years. Sometimes, certain types of HPV can cause genital warts in males and females. Although rare, it may also cause warts to grow in the throat. Other HPV types can cause normal cells in the body to turn abnormal, and might lead to cancer over time such as cervical cancer. The types of HPV that cause warts are not the same types that cause cancer.</p>
